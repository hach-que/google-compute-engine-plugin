    Enable this option if the launched machine is a Windows VM. The Windows VM must have the OpenSSH server feature
    installed on it, Java installed on it, and you must have configured an administrative user with a username and password.
    <p>
        The configured username and password should be set in the "Windows Username" and "Windows Password"
        fields.
    </p>

        You can use the following Startup Script to automatically set up the minimum requirements. In this example
        the Windows username is "Build" and the password is "password123".
